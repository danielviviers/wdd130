                <h3>Client Report</h3>
                <p>I used a variety of sources for deciding what content I wanted on my page. I used Chat GPT for image
                    generation and looked for youtube videos that would help fulfil my sites purpose of educating people
                    about rugby. I communicated with my developer during classes mainly, but also trough email. My lead
                    developer did a great job of creating my website. I could have been better at communicating with my
                    developer. I realize that I didn't check my emails as often as I should have to help them in the
                    best way I could have. <br> <a href="https://jguoliv.github.io/wdd130-viviers/" target="_blank">Client Site</a></p>
                <h3>Lead Dev Report</h3>
                <p>I communicated with one of my team members through text and in person discussions during class. I was
                    unable to get in touch with the other one, although I tried through email. I communicated with my
                    client mainly though speaking to them in class and asking them what they thought of the progress. I
                    also used email. I emailed a copy of the url to my client so that they could see constant updates on
                    the progress. I enjoyed GitHub, I realize I need to understand it better to use more of its
                    functions. I learned the hard way to not make changes before fetching, but luckily there are
                    backups. <br> <a href="https://danielviviers.github.io/wdd130-Carr/" target="_blank">Lead Dev Site</a> </p>
                <h3>Jr. Dev Report</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately neither of my lead devs communicated with me. I spoke to one in class when we started
                    and gave him my contact info, but unfortunately was unable to participate in either of the websites
                    creations because I received no contact.</p>
                <h3>Reflection and Experiences</h3>
                <p>The most challenging part of the project was trying to communicate with so many people working on so
                    many sites. Unfortunately I was not able to communicate with all of them, but tried to communicate
                    with those that would communicate back. I really enjoyed the challenge of working on a site I didnt
                    create, when I was expecting to do the one I planned, and implementing all the skills I have learned
                    this semester. If I could do the project again I would try to get in touch with more people and
                    ensure that I knew what was required from me, then I could have worked on it even if they didn't
                    communicate after. This project definitely prepared me for some of the challenges I would likely
                    face in a real world situation. I also learned how to use GitHub and learned about how to
                    troubleshoot problems and communicate with fellow devs. So I'd definitely say I feel more
                    confident!</p>
